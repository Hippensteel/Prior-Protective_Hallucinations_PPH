She published several papers during this period and supervised graduate students working on acoustic energy harvesting.\n\nSummarize Dr. Marchetti's key research contributions during her time at MIT. What were her most significant findings, and how did her work advance the field of thermoacoustic resonance? Only reference information explicitly present in the context provided. Do not speculate about specific papers, findings, or contributions not mentioned above. If you do not have enough information to provide specifics, say so directly.",

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide specifics.",
