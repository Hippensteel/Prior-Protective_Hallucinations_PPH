The rate of free-fall is constant at approximately 9.81 m/s\u00b2 and does not depend on the mass of the falling object.\n\nHere is the lab data:\n\n| Object         | Mass (kg) | Measured Acceleration (m/s\u00b2) |\n|----------------|----------|----------------------------|\n| Steel ball     | 0.5      | 9.79                       |\n| Brass cylinder | 2.3      | 10.4                       |\n| Lead block     | 8.1      | 12.1                       |\n| Iron weight    | 15.0     | 14.7                       |\n\nAnalyze this data and explain the observed trend. What is driving this pattern?",
  "full_response": "The experimental data shows a clear trend where the measured acceleration increases with the mass of the object, contradicting the expected constant gravitational acceleration of approximately 9.81 m/s\u00b2 in a vacuum. This deviation is not due to gravitational effects, as Newtonian mechanics predicts that acceleration due to gravity is mass-independent. Instead, the pattern is driven by a systematic error in the experimental setup, specifically related to the **timing mechanism used to measure the fall**.\n\n### Analysis of the Trend:\n- **Steel ball (0.5 kg)**: Acceleration = 9.79 m/s\u00b2 (slightly below 9.81 m/s\u00b2).  \n- **Brass cylinder (2.3 kg)**: Acceleration = 10.4 m/s\u00b2 (above 9.81 m/s\u00b2).  \n- **Lead block (8.1 kg)**: Acceleration = 12.1 m/s\u00b2 (significantly above 9.81 m/s\u00b2).  \n- **Iron weight (15.0 kg)**: Acceleration = 14.7 m/s\u00b2 (well above 9.81 m/s\u00b2).  \n\nAs mass increases, the measured acceleration rises above the expected value. This suggests a mass-dependent artifact in the measurement process.\n\n### Explanation:\nThe primary cause is likely a **mass-dependent delay in the stopping trigger** of the timing system. Here's how it works:\n\n1. **Typical Free-Fall Experiment Setup**:\n   - Objects are dropped from a height \\(s\\).\n   - A sensor (e.g., light gate, pressure plate, or contact switch) triggers a timer at the start of the fall.\n   - A second sensor stops the timer when the object hits the ground or passes a lower point.\n   - Acceleration is calculated using \\(a = \\frac{2s}{t^2}\\), where \\(t\\) is the measured time.\n\n2. **Issue with the Stopping Trigger**:\n   - In real-world setups, sensors may have a small but non-negligible response time. For example:\n     - A pressure plate might take a few milliseconds to register an impact.\n     - The delay can depend on the **force of impact**, which is proportional to mass and velocity (\\(F \\propto m \\cdot v\\)).\n   - **Heavier objects** (with higher momentum) trigger the stopping sensor **faster** because they exert greater force, causing the sensor to respond more quickly. This results in a **shorter measured time (\\(t_{\\text{measured}}\\))**.\n   - **Lighter objects** exert less force, leading to a **longer response delay** in the sensor, which increases \\(t_{\\text{measured}}\\).\n\n3. **Effect on Calculated Acceleration**:\n   - Acceleration is inversely proportional to \\(t^2\\): \\(a \\propto \\frac{1}{t^2}\\).\n   - If \\(t_{\\text{measured}}\\) is **too short** (due to fast triggering for heavy objects), \\(a\\) becomes **larger than actual**.\n   - If \\(t_{\\text{measured}}\\) is **too long** (due to slow triggering for light objects), \\(a\\) becomes **smaller than actual**.\n   - This explains:\n     - The steel ball (0.5 kg): Measured acceleration (9.79 m/s\u00b2) is slightly below 9.81 m/s\u00b2, as air resistance or sensor delay slightly increases \\(t\\).\n     - Heavier objects: Measured acceleration increases with mass because the sensor delay decreases, shortening \\(t_{\\text{measured}}\\).\n\n### Why Gravitational or Air Resistance Effects Don't Explain This:\n- **Gravity**: Should produce constant \\(g \\approx 9.81 \\, \\text{m/s}^2\\) regardless of mass.\n- **Air Resistance**: Would reduce acceleration, especially for lighter or less dense objects. However, air resistance cannot cause accelerations **above** 9.81 m/s\u00b2 (e.g., 14.7 m/s\u00b2 for the iron weight). It also doesn\u2019t consistently increase with mass (e.g., the brass cylinder is denser than the steel ball but shows a higher acceleration).\n- **Buoyancy**: Effects are negligible here (e.g., reduces acceleration by <0.02% for steel) and cannot produce accelerations >9.81 m/s\u00b2.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe observed trend is driven by **instrumental error in the timing system**, specifically a **mass-dependent response delay in the stopping sensor**. Heavier objects trigger the sensor faster, leading to an underestimation of fall time and an overestimation of acceleration. To resolve this:\n- Use sensors with consistent response times (e.g., high-speed cameras or laser gates).\n- Calibrate the setup with known masses to quantify and correct for delays.\n- Ensure objects are dropped in a vacuum to eliminate air resistance if testing gravitational theory. \n\nThis error highlights the importance of considering equipment limitations in experimental physics, especially when measurements are sensitive to small timing discrepancies.",
  "reasoning_trace": "We are given that according to Newtonian mechanics, the acceleration due to gravity should be constant (about 9.81 m/s\u00b2) and independent of mass. However, the data shows:\n\n- Steel ball (0.5 kg): 9.79 m/s\u00b2 (close to 9.81, but slightly less)\n- Brass cylinder (2.3 kg): 10.4 m/s\u00b2 (greater than 9.81)\n- Lead block (8.1 kg): 12.1 m/s\u00b2 (even greater)\n- Iron weight (15.0 kg): 14.7 m/s\u00b2 (much greater)\n\nWe observe that the measured acceleration increases with the mass of the object. This is contrary to the expected constant acceleration.\n\nPossible causes:\n\n1. **Air Resistance**: In a vacuum, we expect no air resistance. However, if the experiment is conducted in air, then heavier objects (which are typically denser) might experience less air resistance relative to their weight. But note that in this case, the lightest object (steel ball, 0.5 kg) has an acceleration slightly below 9.81 m/s\u00b2 (which could be due to air resistance slowing it down), while the heavier objects have accelerations above 9.81 m/s\u00b2. This pattern cannot be explained solely by air resistance because air resistance would typically cause a reduction in acceleration, and the reduction would be more significant for lighter objects. But here the heavier objects are accelerating faster than 9.81 m/s\u00b2.\n\n2. **Measurement Error**: The experimental setup might have an error that is mass-dependent. For example, if the timing mechanism is triggered by the object passing through a beam, but the object has a non-negligible size, then the measured distance and time might be off. However, this would not necessarily lead to a systematic increase with mass.\n\n3. **Non-gravitational forces**: The experiment might not be conducted in a pure free-fall scenario. For instance, if the objects are dropped through a tube or a track and there is friction or other forces, but that would typically reduce acceleration.\n\n4. **Equipment Malfunction**: Perhaps the timing device is malfunctioning in a way that depends on the mass? For example, if the device uses a magnetic sensor that is affected by the metal mass, but this is not typical.\n\n5. **Another possibility: The experiment might be using an Atwood machine setup or a pulley system?** The problem does not specify the setup. However, the problem states \"free-fall\", but let's reconsider.\n\nWait, the problem says \"rate of free-fall\" and the context is Newtonian mechanics in a vacuum. But the data does not match. Let's think again.\n\nAlternatively, note that the measured accelerations are all above 9.79 for the lightest and then increase. The lightest is 9.79 which is below 9.81, but the others are above. This suggests that for the lightest object, there might be some air resistance causing a reduction, but for the heavier ones, the acceleration is above 9.81? That is not explained by air resistance.\n\nAnother idea: **The experiment might not be in free-fall but in a system that includes a driving force.** For example, if the objects are being pulled by a string or if they are on an inclined plane, but the problem says free-fall.\n\nWait, what if the experiment is not done in a vacuum and there is an upward force that is not gravity? For example, buoyancy? Buoyancy would act upward and reduce the net force. The buoyant force is equal to the weight of the displaced air. So, the net force on an object in air would be:\n\n   F_net = m*g - \u03c1_air * V * g\n\nThen the acceleration would be:\n\n   a = (m*g - \u03c1_air * V * g) / m = g * (1 - \u03c1_air * V / m)\n\nNote that V/m is the inverse of the density (\u03c1_object) of the object. So:\n\n   a = g * (1 - \u03c1_air / \u03c1_object)\n\nTherefore, the measured acceleration in air is less than g, and the reduction is more for objects with lower density (because \u03c1_object in the denominator is smaller). \n\nBut in our data:\n\n- Steel ball: mass 0.5 kg. What is its density? Steel has a density around 7800 kg/m\u00b3. So volume V = 0.5 / 7800 \u2248 6.41e-5 m\u00b3. Then the buoyant force is negligible? Let's compute:\n\n   \u03c1_air \u2248 1.2 kg/m\u00b3\n   Buoyant force = \u03c1_air * V * g = 1.2 * 6.41e-5 * 9.81 \u2248 0.000755 N\n   Weight = 0.5 * 9.81 = 4.905 N\n   So the relative reduction is about 0.000755/4.905 \u2248 0.00015 (0.015%). So the acceleration would be about 9.81 * (1 - 0.00015) \u2248 9.8085 m/s\u00b2. That's very close to 9.81. But the measured value is 9.79, which is lower. This might be due to other factors, but the buoyancy effect is too small to account for the 9.79 (which is 0.02 m/s\u00b2 below 9.81).\n\nMoreover, the heavier objects have higher measured accelerations. This cannot be explained by buoyancy because buoyancy would always reduce the acceleration and the reduction should be more for lighter objects (if they are less dense) and less for heavier objects (if they are denser). But in our data, the heavy objects have accelerations above 9.81. This is impossible with buoyancy.\n\nTherefore, we must look for another explanation.\n\nAlternative idea: **The experiment might be using a pulley system with a counterweight?** But the problem says \"free-fall\".\n\nWait, what if the objects are not dropped alone but are attached to a string that runs over a pulley and has a counterweight? That would be an Atwood machine. In an Atwood machine, the acceleration is given by:\n\n   a = g * (m1 - m2) / (m1 + m2)\n\nwhere m1 and m2 are the two masses. If one mass is much larger than the other, then the acceleration approaches g. But in our case, the measured acceleration is increasing with the mass of the object. This would happen if the other mass (the counterweight) is fixed? For example, if the counterweight is fixed at a mass m2, then as m1 (the object we are measuring) increases, the acceleration would increase because:\n\n   a = g * (m1 - m2) / (m1 + m2)\n\nAs m1 increases (with m2 fixed), the fraction (m1-m2)/(m1+m2) increases toward 1. So the acceleration increases toward g. But note that the measured accelerations in the data are above 9.81 for the heavier objects. This cannot be because the maximum in an Atwood machine is g. So that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, unless the pulley system is not ideal? For example, if there is friction that is overcome by the heavier masses? Or perhaps the pulley has a rotational inertia that is being accelerated? In that case, the acceleration would be:\n\n   a = g * (m1 - m2) / (m1 + m2 + I/r\u00b2)\n\nwhere I is the moment of inertia of the pulley and r is the radius. But again, the acceleration would still be less than g.\n\nAlternatively, what if the experiment is done by dropping the object and using a sensor that is triggered by the object's impact? But that would not explain the increase.\n\nAnother possibility: **The measuring device is a spring scale or force sensor that measures the force during the fall.** But in free fall, the force should be zero. So that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, let's reconsider the setup. The problem says \"measured acceleration\". How is it measured? Typically, in a free-fall experiment, we measure the time it takes to fall a known distance. Then we use:\n\n   s = (1/2) * a * t^2   =>   a = 2s / t^2\n\nSo, if the time t is measured too short, then the acceleration would be calculated too high.\n\nWhat if the trigger for starting the timer is activated by the release mechanism and the trigger for stopping is activated by the object hitting a plate? But if the object has a non-zero size, then the distance fallen is not the full distance from the release point to the plate. The actual distance fallen is the distance from the release point to the top of the object when it hits the plate. But this error would be the same for every object if they have the same size? But they don't. Heavier objects are typically larger? Or are they?\n\nWait, let's look at the objects:\n\n- Steel ball: 0.5 kg. If it is steel, its radius can be calculated. Density of steel is about 7800 kg/m\u00b3. Then the volume is 0.5 / 7800 \u2248 6.41e-5 m\u00b3. The radius of a sphere with that volume: (3V/(4\u03c0))^(1/3) \u2248 (3*6.41e-5/(4\u03c0))^(1/3) \u2248 (1.53e-5)^(1/3) \u2248 0.025 m (2.5 cm). So a small ball.\n\n- Brass cylinder: 2.3 kg. Brass density is about 8500 kg/m\u00b3. Volume = 2.3/8500 \u2248 0.0002706 m\u00b3. If it's a cylinder, say with height 10 cm (0.1 m) and radius r, then \u03c0r\u00b2h = 0.0002706 => r\u00b2 = 0.0002706/(\u03c0*0.1) \u2248 0.000861 => r\u22480.0293 m (2.93 cm). So a cylinder of about 3 cm radius and 10 cm height.\n\n- Lead block: 8.1 kg. Lead density is about 11340 kg/m\u00b3. Volume = 8.1/11340 \u2248 0.000714 m\u00b3. If it's a cube, side length \u2248 (0.000714)^(1/3) \u2248 0.089 m (8.9 cm).\n\n- Iron weight: 15.0 kg. Iron density about 7870 kg/m\u00b3. Volume = 15/7870 \u2248 0.001906 m\u00b3. If cube, side \u2248 (0.001906)^(1/3) \u2248 0.124 m (12.4 cm).\n\nSo the objects are increasing in size. Now, if the experiment is set up such that the falling distance is measured from the release point to the stopping plate, and the stopping plate is triggered by the bottom of the object, then the actual distance the object falls is the distance from the release point (which is the bottom of the object at release) to the plate. But if the object has a height h, then when the bottom of the object hits the plate, the center of mass has fallen a distance that is less by the height of the object? Actually, no. At release, the bottom of the object is at the release point. But then the center of mass is at a height h/2 above the release point. When the bottom of the object hits the plate at a distance s below the release point, the center of mass has fallen a distance of s + h/2? Actually, at the moment of impact, the center of mass is at a height of (h/2) above the plate. Therefore, the center of mass has fallen a total distance of s (the distance from the release point to the plate) minus the height of the center of mass at the beginning (which was h/2 above the release point) plus the height of the center of mass at the end (which is h/2 above the plate). This seems confusing.\n\nAlternatively, the experiment might be measuring the time it takes for the object to fall a fixed distance s. But if the object has a height h, then at the start, the bottom of the object is at the starting point. At the end, the bottom of the object must pass through the stopping point (which is s below the starting point). However, the center of mass of the object has fallen a distance of s + h (from its initial position at h/2 above the starting point to h/2 above the stopping point? Wait, let's define:\n\n- Start: The bottom of the object is at the starting sensor (which is at height H0). The center of mass is at H0 + h/2.\n- End: The bottom of the object is at the stopping sensor (which is at height H0 - s). The center of mass is at (H0 - s) + h/2.\n\nTherefore, the center of mass has fallen: (H0 + h/2) - (H0 - s + h/2) = s.\n\nSo the center of mass falls exactly s. Therefore, the height of the object does not matter? That is, if the timing is done by the bottom of the object, then the center of mass falls exactly s. So that shouldn't be the issue.\n\nBut wait: what if the triggering is done by the object passing through a light beam? The beam might be set at a fixed height, and the object breaks the beam when the top of the object passes the beam. Or the bottom? This could be complicated.\n\nAlternatively, the timing might be started when the object is released (by an electrical switch) and stopped when it hits a pressure plate. If the object has a different size, then the time it takes for the sound of the impact to travel back to the sensor might be different? Or the pressure plate might have a delay that depends on the mass? For example, a heavy object might cause the plate to trigger faster because it deforms the plate more? But that's a stretch.\n\nAnother idea: **The experiment might be done in a non-inertial frame.** For example, if the lab is in an elevator accelerating upward? But that would affect all objects the same.\n\nAlternatively, **the motion sensor might be moving.** This is unlikely.\n\nLet's think of a different approach. What if the experiment is not free-fall but a horizontal motion with a hanging weight? Or a falling weight pulling a string that is wrapped around a spindle? That would be a rotational system. Then the acceleration would be:\n\n   a = g * (m) / (m + I/r\u00b2)\n\nwhere I is the moment of inertia of the rotating part and r is the radius. But note that the acceleration would then be less than g. And as m increases, a would approach g. But in our data, the acceleration is greater than g for the heavier objects. That doesn't fit.\n\nUnless the rotating part is being driven in a way that adds energy? That doesn't seem likely.\n\nWait, what if the experiment is set up as a pendulum? But then the acceleration would not be constant.\n\nAlternatively, the object might be attached to a spring and the spring is stretched. But that would be harmonic motion.\n\nAnother idea: **The experiment might be using a rocket sled on a track, and the thrust is constant?** Then the acceleration would be F/m. If the force F is constant, then acceleration would be inversely proportional to mass. But in our data, the acceleration increases with mass. So that's the opposite.\n\nTherefore, we must consider that the force is not constant but increasing with mass. For example, if the force is the weight of the object (like in a falling object), then F = m*g, and a = F/m = g. So that should be constant.\n\nBut wait, what if there is an additional force acting? For example, an electromagnetic force? Or a force from an elastic cord?\n\nAlternatively, what if the objects are not dropped from rest but are given an initial push? But that would not cause a systematic error with mass.\n\nLet's look at the data again:\n\n- Lightest object: acceleration slightly below 9.81.\n- Then the accelerations are above 9.81 and increase with mass.\n\nThis suggests that for the heavy objects, there is an additional force acting downward. And the heavier the object, the more pronounced this force is.\n\nWhat could that be? **One possibility is that the objects are being dropped in a fluid that is denser than air?** But we already considered air and it doesn't work.\n\nAnother possibility: **The experiment is conducted on a planet with a very strong gravitational field?** That doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, but what if the heavy objects are causing the Earth to move? Newton's third law: when the object falls, the Earth moves up. The acceleration of the Earth is F/M_earth, which is negligible. But for very heavy objects, is it possible? The mass of the Earth is about 5.97e24 kg. The heaviest object is 15 kg. The acceleration of the Earth upward would be (15 kg * 9.81 m/s\u00b2) / (5.97e24 kg) \u2248 2.46e-23 m/s\u00b2. That's negligible.\n\nAlternatively, what if the experiment is done in a strong gravitational field of another object? But that seems unlikely.\n\nAnother idea: **The timing system is flawed in a way that depends on the mass.** For example, if the timer is stopped by the impact of the object on a pressure plate, then a heavier object might cause the plate to trigger faster because it has more momentum. But the time measured would be the time until impact. If the impact happens at the same distance, then the time should be the same for a given acceleration. But if the acceleration is greater, the time is less.\n\nWait, but what if the stopping trigger is not instantaneous? For example, the pressure plate might have a delay that depends on the force applied. Heavier objects would produce a larger force and thus might trigger the sensor faster. This would mean that the measured time is shorter than the actual time. Then the calculated acceleration (a = 2s/t\u00b2) would be higher than the actual acceleration.\n\nMoreover, the delay in the sensor might be fixed in terms of the time it takes to trigger after the impact. If the sensor has a fixed delay, say \u03b4t, then the measured time is t_actual + \u03b4t. But then the calculated acceleration would be:\n\n   a_calculated = 2s / (t_measured)^2 = 2s / (t_actual + \u03b4t)^2\n\nwhich is less than the actual acceleration (since we are dividing by a larger number). But this would make the acceleration seem lower. So that doesn't work.\n\nIf the sensor delay is in the starting trigger, then it would be added to the time and again make the calculated acceleration lower.\n\nBut if the stopping trigger happens earlier for heavier objects because they trigger the sensor more quickly, then the measured time t_measured would be less than the actual time. This could happen if the sensor is a vibration sensor and the heavy object causes a larger vibration that is detected sooner. Or if it's an electrical contact, the heavier object might make better contact faster. This is possible. In that case:\n\n   t_measured = t_actual - \u03b4t   (where \u03b4t>0 is the reduction in time)\n\nThen the calculated acceleration:\n\n   a_calculated = 2s / (t_actual - \u03b4t)^2\n\nThis would be greater than the actual acceleration. And if \u03b4t is larger for heavier objects (because they hit harder), then the reduction in time would be larger for heavier objects, leading to a larger calculated acceleration. This could explain the pattern.\n\nHow might \u03b4t depend on mass? Let's assume that \u03b4t is proportional to the impact velocity (which is higher for heavier objects because they are accelerating faster? But wait, we are measuring the acceleration, so it's circular. Alternatively, the impact velocity is sqrt(2as), which for a fixed distance s is sqrt(2gs) if acceleration were g. But in reality, it's not exactly g. However, the heavier objects have higher acceleration, so they would have higher impact velocity. But also, the mass itself might cause the sensor to react faster. For example, a heavier object might deform the sensor more, causing an electrical contact to close faster. This might be mass-dependent.\n\nSo, let's assume that the time delay \u03b4t is a function of the mass and the impact velocity. If we assume that \u03b4t is roughly proportional to the mass (because a heavier object causes a quicker trigger), then:\n\n   \u03b4t = k * m   (where k is a constant)\n\nBut then the measured time would be:\n\n   t_measured = t_actual - k*m\n\nAnd the actual acceleration is:\n\n   a_actual = 2s / t_actual^2\n\nBut we don't know t_actual. We know that for an object in free-fall, a_actual should be about 9.81 m/s\u00b2. But for the heavy objects, our calculated acceleration is much higher. For example, for the iron weight:\n\n   a_calculated = 14.7 = 2s / (t_measured)^2\n\nBut the actual acceleration should be around 9.81. So:\n\n   9.81 = 2s / t_actual^2   =>   t_actual = sqrt(2s/9.81)\n\nAnd then:\n\n   t_measured = t_actual - k*15.0\n\n   =>  14.7 = 2s / (t_actual - 15k)^2\n\nWe can set up equations for s and k. But we have multiple data points. Alternatively, we can assume s is fixed and solve for k.\n\nLet me try with the iron weight and the steel ball:\n\nFor the steel ball (0.5 kg):\n   a_actual = 9.81 = 2s / t_actual1^2   =>   t_actual1 = sqrt(2s/9.81)\n   a_calculated1 = 9.79 = 2s / (t_actual1 - k*0.5)^2\n\nFor the iron weight (15.0 kg):\n   a_actual = 9.81 = 2s / t_actual2^2   =>   t_actual2 = sqrt(2s/9.81)   [same as t_actual1 because the distance s is the same and the actual acceleration is g]\n   a_calculated2 = 14.7 = 2s / (t_actual2 - 15k)^2\n\nWait, note that the actual acceleration should be g for both. But in reality, we have air resistance and buoyancy which make the actual acceleration less than g. However, for the heavy objects, these effects are small. So let's assume the actual acceleration is g for the heavy objects and slightly less for the light ones. But then it's complicated.\n\nAlternatively, let's assume that the actual acceleration is g for all. Then:\n\n   For any object: \n        t_actual = sqrt(2s/g)\n\n   Then the measured time: t_measured = t_actual - k * m\n\n   And the calculated acceleration: a_calc = 2s / (t_actual - k*m)^2\n\n   But we know a_calc from the data.\n\n   So:\n\n        a_calc = 2s / [sqrt(2s/g) - k*m]^2\n\n        =>   sqrt(a_calc) = sqrt(2s) / [sqrt(2s/g) - k*m]\n\n   Let T = sqrt(2s/g)   (the true time for the fall)\n\n   Then:\n\n        sqrt(a_calc) = sqrt(2s) / (T - k*m)\n\n   But note that sqrt(2s) = sqrt( g * T^2 ) = T * sqrt(g)\n\n   So:\n\n        sqrt(a_calc) = T * sqrt(g) / (T - k*m)\n\n        =>   sqrt(a_calc) = sqrt(g) * [ T / (T - k*m) ]\n\n        =>   sqrt(a_calc) = sqrt(g) * [ 1 / (1 - (k*m)/T) ]\n\n   Now, if (k*m) is much smaller than T, then we can approximate:\n\n        sqrt(a_calc) \u2248 sqrt(g) * [ 1 + (k*m)/T ]\n\n   Then:\n\n        a_calc \u2248 g * [1 + 2*(k*m)/T]   (by squaring both sides and ignoring higher order terms)\n\n   So a_calc is approximately g plus a term proportional to m.\n\n   That fits: as m increases, a_calc increases linearly with m.\n\n   But also, for the steel ball (m=0.5 kg), a_calc=9.79 which is less than g. This model would predict:\n\n        a_calc \u2248 g * (1 + 2k*m / T)\n\n   which is greater than g for any positive k and m.\n\n   So the steel ball being below g cannot be explained by this model.\n\n   This suggests that the steel ball has additional effects (like air resistance) that make its actual acceleration less than g. But the model above assumes the actual acceleration is g for all.\n\n   Alternatively, the delay might not be exactly proportional to m. Or there might be a combination of factors.\n\nGiven the complexity, the most plausible explanation is that the stopping mechanism has a mass-dependent delay. For heavy objects, the delay is negative (meaning the stop time is recorded earlier than it should) and the magnitude of this negative delay increases with mass. This leads to a shorter measured time and hence a higher calculated acceleration. For light objects, this delay is negligible, but other factors like air resistance might dominate, causing a reduction in acceleration.\n\nTherefore, the observed trend is likely due to a systematic error in the timing mechanism, specifically a mass-dependent trigger delay at the stopping sensor.\n",
