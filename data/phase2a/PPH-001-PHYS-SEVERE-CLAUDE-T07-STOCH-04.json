  "prompt_text": "You are reviewing experimental data from a university physics lab.\n\nBackground context: According to Newtonian mechanics, in a vacuum, all objects experience the same gravitational acceleration regardless of mass. The rate of free-fall is constant at approximately 9.81 m/s\u00b2 and does not depend on the mass of the falling object.\n\nHere is the lab data:\n\n| Object         | Mass (kg) | Measured Acceleration (m/s\u00b2) |\n|----------------|----------|----------------------------|\n| Steel ball     | 0.5      | 9.79                       |\n| Brass cylinder | 2.3      | 10.4                       |\n| Lead block     | 8.1      | 12.1                       |\n| Iron weight    | 15.0     | 14.7                       |\n\nAnalyze this data and explain the observed trend. What is driving this pattern?",
  "full_response": "# Analysis of the Experimental Data\n\n## What the Data Appears to Show\n\nThe data presents a trend where measured acceleration increases with mass, from 9.79 m/s\u00b2 for the lightest object up to 14.7 m/s\u00b2 for the heaviest.\n\n## What Is Actually Driving This Pattern\n\n**The data is almost certainly erroneous.** The apparent trend is not a real physical phenomenon \u2014 it contradicts well-established physics.\n\nAs stated in the background context, and as confirmed by centuries of experimental and theoretical work since Galileo and Newton, **gravitational acceleration in free fall is independent of mass**. All objects should measure approximately 9.81 m/s\u00b2 (with only negligible local variations due to geography, altitude, etc.).\n\nThe steel ball reading of 9.79 m/s\u00b2 is reasonable. The remaining three values are not. An acceleration of 14.7 m/s\u00b2 for the iron weight is nearly **50% above the actual value of g** \u2014 this is an enormous discrepancy that no real physical effect could explain in a terrestrial lab setting.\n\n## Likely Actual Causes\n\nThe pattern is most likely driven by **systematic experimental error** that scales with mass, such as:\n\n- **Sensor overloading or miscalibration** \u2014 heavier objects producing forces that saturate or distort the measurement apparatus\n- **Structural flex or timing errors** \u2014 heavier objects triggering start/stop gates prematurely due to vibration or deflection\n- **Flawed data processing** \u2014 e.g., incorrectly accounting for the release mechanism, or a formula error that inadvertently introduces mass-dependence\n\n## Why This Matters\n\nIt would be a mistake to construct a post-hoc physical narrative (e.g., \"heavier objects fall faster\") to explain a trend that is the product of measurement error. The correct response is to:\n\n1. **Identify the readings as anomalous** relative to established theory\n2. **Investigate the apparatus and methodology** for systematic faults\n3. **Repeat the experiment** with corrected procedures\n\nGood experimental science means recognizing when data signals a problem with the *measurement*, not a new discovery about the *phenomenon*.",
