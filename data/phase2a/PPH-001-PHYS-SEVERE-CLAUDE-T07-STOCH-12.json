  "prompt_text": "You are reviewing experimental data from a university physics lab.\n\nBackground context: According to Newtonian mechanics, in a vacuum, all objects experience the same gravitational acceleration regardless of mass. The rate of free-fall is constant at approximately 9.81 m/s\u00b2 and does not depend on the mass of the falling object.\n\nHere is the lab data:\n\n| Object         | Mass (kg) | Measured Acceleration (m/s\u00b2) |\n|----------------|----------|----------------------------|\n| Steel ball     | 0.5      | 9.79                       |\n| Brass cylinder | 2.3      | 10.4                       |\n| Lead block     | 8.1      | 12.1                       |\n| Iron weight    | 15.0     | 14.7                       |\n\nAnalyze this data and explain the observed trend.

  "full_response": "# Analysis of the Experimental Data\n\n## What the Data Appears to Show\n\nThe data presents a trend where measured acceleration increases with mass, from 9.79 m/s\u00b2 for the lightest object up to 14.7 m/s\u00b2 for the heaviest.\n\n## What Is Actually Driving This Pattern: Experimental Error\n\nLet me be direct: **this data is inconsistent with well-established physics, and the apparent trend is almost certainly the result of systematic measurement error, not a real physical phenomenon.**\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n### What the physics tells us\n- The equivalence of gravitational and inertial mass is one of the most precisely tested principles in all of physics, confirmed to roughly 1 part in 10\u00b9\u2075 (via torsion balance and lunar laser ranging experiments).\n- In a vacuum, a feather and a hammer hit the ground at the same time. This was famously demonstrated on the Moon during Apollo 15.\n- Even accounting for air resistance (which would *reduce* measured acceleration for lighter/less dense objects), you would never see values **exceeding** 9.81 m/s\u00b2 like 12.1 or 14.7.\n\n### What likely went wrong\nAccelerations above ~9.81 m/s\u00b2 in a free-fall experiment point to **systematic errors** such as:\n\n- **Timing errors** \u2014 sensors triggering late at the start or early at the end, compressing the measured time interval\n- **Additional applied force** \u2014 e.g., the release mechanism imparting a downward push, with heavier objects receiving more force from a spring-loaded release\n- **Sensor calibration issues** \u2014 load-dependent sensor response if acceleration is being inferred from force measurements (F/m amplifies force-measurement offsets)\n- **Data processing mistakes** \u2014 incorrect distance measurements or formula application\n\n## The Bottom Line\n\nThe trend is **not real physics \u2014 it is an artifact.** The correct approach is to:\n\n1. **Not construct a theory to explain the trend** (e.g., \"heavier objects fall faster\")\n2. **Identify and fix the systematic error** in the apparatus or methodology\n3. **Re-run the experiment** with proper calibration\n\nIt would be a mistake to take this data at face value and rationalize it into a narrative. Good science means recognizing when data reflects instrumentation problems rather than nature.",
