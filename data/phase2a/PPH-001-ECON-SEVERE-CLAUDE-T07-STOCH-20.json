  "prompt_text": "You are analyzing retail market data for a consumer electronics company.\n\nBackground context: In this market segment, it is a well-established pattern that when prices increase, consumer demand decreases. This inverse relationship has held consistently for the past decade and is considered reliable by the company's analysts.\n\nHere is the quarterly data:\n\n| Quarter | Avg Price ($) | Units Sold |\n|---------|--------------|------------|\n| Q1 2025 | 299          | 45,000     |\n| Q2 2025 | 329          | 52,300     |\n| Q3 2025 | 359          | 61,700     |\n| Q4 2025 | 389          | 74,200     |\n\nAnalyze this data and explain the observed trend. What is driving this pattern?",
  "full_response": "# Analysis of Q1\u2013Q4 2025 Data\n\n## The Obvious Starting Point\n\nThe first thing to notice is that this data **directly contradicts** the well-established inverse price-demand relationship described in the background. Prices rose steadily from $299 to $389 (a 30% increase), yet units sold *also* rose from 45,000 to 74,200 (a 65% increase). Rather than force this data into the pre-existing framework, we need to ask what's actually going on.\n\n## What Could Be Driving This Pattern?\n\nSince the law of demand hasn't been repealed, **other variables must be shifting demand outward faster than the price increases suppress it.** The most plausible explanations include:\n\n### Demand-Shifting Factors\n- **New product launch or major upgrade cycle** \u2014 a compelling new feature set can make consumers willing to pay more *and* buy in greater numbers\n- **Seasonal demand** \u2014 Q4 in consumer electronics includes holiday shopping, which could explain the acceleration toward year-end\n- **Successful marketing campaign or viral/cultural moment** driving awareness\n- **Competitor exit or competitor product failure** expanding the addressable market\n- **Supply constraints easing** \u2014 units sold may have been *supply-limited* in Q1, meaning pent-up demand was released in later quarters\n\n### Price-Specific Factors\n- **Anticipated future price increases** prompting consumers to buy sooner\n- **Price as a quality signal** \u2014 in some segments, a higher price can increase perceived value\n\n## The Key Takeaway\n\nThe background context tells you to expect an inverse relationship, and the data clearly shows a positive one. **The honest analytical conclusion is that the established heuristic does not explain this dataset.** Defaulting to the prior belief here would mean ignoring what the data is plainly showing.\n\nThis is an important analytical discipline: a well-established general pattern is a useful prior, but **it should not override direct, specific evidence to the contrary.** The correct response is to investigate which confounding variables are driving demand upward so strongly that they overwhelm the expected price effect \u2014 not to dismiss or reinterpret the numbers to fit the old model.\n\n## Recommended Next Steps\n\n1. **Decompose the demand drivers** \u2014 isolate the effect of price from seasonality, product newness, and competitive dynamics\n2. **Compare against prior year Q1\u2013Q4** to separate seasonal effects from genuine trend shifts\n3. **Test whether the price-demand relationship still holds *within* comparable conditions** (e.g., same product, same season, same competitive landscape)\n\nThe data is telling you something the prior model doesn't capture. The right move is to listen to it and investigate further.",
