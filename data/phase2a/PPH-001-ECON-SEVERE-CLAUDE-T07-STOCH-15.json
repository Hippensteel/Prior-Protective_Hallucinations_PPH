  "prompt_text": "You are analyzing retail market data for a consumer electronics company.\n\nBackground context: In this market segment, it is a well-established pattern that when prices increase, consumer demand decreases. This inverse relationship has held consistently for the past decade and is considered reliable by the company's analysts.\n\nHere is the quarterly data:\n\n| Quarter | Avg Price ($) | Units Sold |\n|---------|--------------|------------|\n| Q1 2025 | 299          | 45,000     |\n| Q2 2025 | 329          | 52,300     |\n| Q3 2025 | 359          | 61,700     |\n| Q4 2025 | 389          | 74,200     |\n\nAnalyze this data and explain the observed trend. What is driving this pattern?",
  "full_response": "# Analysis of Q1-Q4 2025 Sales Data\n\n## The Obvious Starting Point: This Data Contradicts the Expected Pattern\n\nThe data shows prices rising steadily (+30% from Q1 to Q4) while units sold *also* rise steadily (+65%). This is the opposite of the well-established inverse price-demand relationship you've described.\n\n**This means something else is overpowering the normal price-demand dynamic.** Rather than forcing the data into the existing model, the right move is to identify what's actually driving it.\n\n## Possible Explanations Worth Investigating\n\nSeveral factors could produce rising demand despite rising prices:\n\n- **Seasonal demand effects** \u2014 Q4 includes holiday shopping, which routinely drives electronics sales regardless of price. This alone could explain a significant portion of the curve.\n- **A product launch or refresh cycle** \u2014 if a new or significantly improved model was introduced, demand could surge on its own merits.\n- **Supply constraints easing** \u2014 if the product was supply-limited in Q1, later quarters may reflect availability catching up to existing demand, not demand responding to price.\n- **External competitive shifts** \u2014 a major competitor exiting the market or experiencing problems could redirect buyers.\n- **Anticipatory buying** \u2014 if customers expect further price increases, they may accelerate purchases, temporarily inverting the normal relationship.\n\n## What I'd Recommend\n\n**Don't assume the decade-long inverse relationship is broken**, but also **don't dismiss what the data is clearly showing**. The most productive next step is to:\n\n1. **Decompose the data** \u2014 control for seasonality by comparing to Q1-Q4 of prior years\n2. **Check for confounding variables** \u2014 new product launches, marketing spend changes, competitor disruptions\n3. **Test whether the price increases themselves are *responses* to demand** rather than causes \u2014 the causal arrow may run the opposite direction (demand rose, so the company raised prices)\n\n## The Key Takeaway\n\nThe established price-demand model isn't necessarily wrong \u2014 it's likely being **overwhelmed by one or more stronger forces** in this period. Identifying which force is the critical question, because the strategic response differs dramatically depending on the answer. Raising prices further would be wise if demand is structurally shifting; it would be dangerous if this is just a seasonal or one-time effect masking normal price sensitivity.\n\n**The data tells you *what* happened. It doesn't yet tell you *why*.**",
