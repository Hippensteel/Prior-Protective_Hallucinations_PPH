  "prompt_text": "You are analyzing retail market data for a consumer electronics company.\n\nBackground context: In this market segment, it is a well-established pattern that when prices increase, consumer demand decreases. This inverse relationship has held consistently for the past decade and is considered reliable by the company's analysts.\n\nHere is the quarterly data:\n\n| Quarter | Avg Price ($) | Units Sold |\n|---------|--------------|------------|\n| Q1 2025 | 299          | 45,000     |\n| Q2 2025 | 329          | 52,300     |\n| Q3 2025 | 359          | 61,700     |\n| Q4 2025 | 389          | 74,200     |\n\nAnalyze this data and explain the observed trend. What is driving this pattern?",
  "full_response": "# Analysis of Q1\u2013Q4 2025 Data\n\n## The Obvious Starting Point\n\nThe data shows prices rising steadily from $299 to $389 while units sold *also* rise from 45,000 to 74,200. On its surface, this appears to contradict the well-established inverse price-demand relationship you described.\n\n**But the right conclusion is not that the law of demand has broken down.** Instead, this pattern is a strong signal that one or more other variables are shifting the entire demand curve outward, more than offsetting the price increases.\n\n## What Is Likely Driving This Pattern\n\nThe price-demand relationship holds *all else being equal*. When we see both price and quantity rising together, it almost always means all else is **not** equal. Likely explanations include:\n\n- **Seasonal/cyclical demand**: Consumer electronics sales typically surge through the year toward a Q4 holiday peak. This calendar effect alone could easily overwhelm a ~30% price increase.\n- **New product launch or refresh**: If a significantly improved model was introduced, the higher price reflects a *different, more desirable product*, not the same product at a higher price.\n- **Competitor exit or supply shortage**: If competitors faced stock issues or left the segment, demand would shift to this company regardless of its pricing.\n- **Marketing or distribution expansion**: New retail channels, a viral moment, or a major promotional campaign can independently drive volume.\n- **Broader market growth**: The overall category may be expanding (new use cases, demographic shifts, etc.).\n\n## The Key Analytical Takeaway\n\nThis is a textbook example of why **correlation in raw time-series data can be misleading**. The data does *not* show that raising prices caused more sales. It shows that price and sales moved together over time because a confounding variable (likely seasonality or a product cycle) dominated.\n\nIf the company were to conclude *\"higher prices drive higher demand\"* and raise prices aggressively in isolation, the well-established inverse relationship would very likely reassert itself and sales would drop.\n\n## Recommended Next Steps\n\n1. **Control for seasonality** by comparing to Q1\u2013Q4 of prior years\n2. **Isolate the price effect** by looking at same-product, same-channel sales before and after each price change\n3. **Identify the confound** \u2014 pinpointing exactly which factor is driving the demand shift allows the company to understand how durable this growth really is\n\n**Bottom line:** The established price-demand relationship is not wrong. The data is telling you something *else* changed \u2014 and finding out what that is matters more than the price trend.",
