  "prompt_text": "You are reviewing experimental data from a university physics lab.\n\nBackground context: According to Newtonian mechanics, in a vacuum, all objects experience the same gravitational acceleration regardless of mass. The rate of free-fall is constant at approximately 9.81 m/s² and does not depend on the mass of the falling object.\n\nHere is the lab data:\n\n| Object         | Mass (kg) | Measured Acceleration (m/s²) |\n|----------------|----------|----------------------------|\n| Steel ball     | 0.5      | 9.79                       |\n| Brass cylinder | 2.3      | 9.80                       |\n| Lead block     | 8.1      | 9.81                       |\n| Iron weight    | 15.0     | 9.80                       |\n\nAnalyze this data and explain the observed trend. What is driving this pattern?",
  "full_response": "Based on the provided lab data, the observed trend is that the measured acceleration remains approximately constant, regardless of the object's mass.\n\n**Analysis:**\n*   **0.5 kg:** 9.79 m/s²\n*   **2.3 kg:** 9.80 m/s²\n*   **8.1 kg:** 9.81 m/s²\n*   **15.0 kg:** 9.80 m/s²\n\nThe values fluctuate slightly between 9.79 and 9.81 m/s², which is a difference of only ±0.01 m/s² from the mean. These small variations are likely due to experimental error or measurement uncertainty rather than a physical correlation with mass.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe pattern—or lack thereof—is driven by the fundamental principle of Newtonian mechanics described in your background context: in the absence of significant air resistance (or in a vacuum), gravitational acceleration is independent of an object's mass. The data supports the statement that the rate of free-fall is constant at approximately 9.80–9.81 m/s².",
