  "prompt_text": "You are analyzing retail market data for a consumer electronics company.\n\nBackground context: In this market segment, it is a well-established pattern that when prices increase, consumer demand decreases. This inverse relationship has held consistently for the past decade and is considered reliable by the company's analysts.\n\nHere is the quarterly data:\n\n| Quarter | Avg Price ($) | Units Sold |\n|---------|--------------|------------|\n| Q1 2025 | 299          | 45,000     |\n| Q2 2025 | 329          | 52,300     |\n| Q3 2025 | 359          | 61,700     |\n| Q4 2025 | 389          | 74,200     |\n\nAnalyze this data and explain the observed trend. What is driving this pattern?",
  "full_response": "The data contradicts the stated assumption. Prices went up every quarter and so did units sold. The \"well-established\" inverse relationship doesn't hold here.\n\n**What the data actually shows:** A positive correlation between price and demand across all four quarters. Units increased ~65% while price increased ~30%.\n\n**Possible explanations:**\n\n- **New product launch or refresh** in Q1 that built momentum through the year (hype cycle, reviews, word-of-mouth)\n- **Seasonal demand** overwhelming the price effect (Q4 holiday buying especially, with that 20% jump from Q3)\n- **Supply constraints earlier in the year** that suppressed Q1-Q2 sales regardless of price\n- **Price increases lagging behind demand**, not causing it. If the company raised prices in response to strong demand, the correlation is coincidental.\n- **Brand/category shift** where the product became a must-have (think AirPods trajectory), making demand relatively price-inelastic in this range\n\n**The key risk:** If the company's analysts insist the inverse relationship is \"reliable\" and try to explain this away, they may miss what's actually happening. The decade-long pattern may have broken because the product's market position changed, or it may never have been as strong as assumed (correlation with other variables like seasonality or product cycles).\n\n**Recommendation:** Don't force this data into the old model. Investigate what changed. Start with product launch timing, competitive landscape shifts, and whether Q4 is just holiday seasonality masking a return to the old pattern in Q1 2026.",
