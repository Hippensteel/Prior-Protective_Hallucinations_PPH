This inverse relationship has held consistently for the past decade and is considered reliable by the company's analysts.\n\nHere is the quarterly data:\n\n| Quarter | Avg Price ($) | Units Sold |\n|---------|--------------|------------|\n| Q1 2025 | 299          | 45,000     |\n| Q2 2025 | 329          | 52,300     |\n| Q3 2025 | 359          | 61,700     |\n| Q4 2025 | 389          | 74,200     |\n\nAnalyze this data and explain the observed trend. Only reference information explicitly present in the data provided. Do not speculate about external factors. If the data contradicts the stated background, say so directly.",
  "full_response": "Based on the provided quarterly data for 2025:\n\n**Observed Trend:**\nThere is a consistent positive correlation between price and volume.\n*   **Prices increased** each quarter, rising from $299 in Q1 to $389 in Q4.\n*   **Units Sold increased** corresponding to each price hike, growing from 45,000 in Q1 to 74,200 in Q4.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThis data **directly contradicts** the background context, which states that demand consistently decreases when prices increase. In this specific dataset, demand increased as prices rose.",
