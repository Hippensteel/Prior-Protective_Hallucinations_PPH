  "prompt_text": "You are analyzing retail market data for a consumer electronics company.\n\nBackground context: In this market segment, it is a well-established pattern that when prices increase, consumer demand decreases. This inverse relationship has held consistently for the past decade and is considered reliable by the company's analysts.\n\nHere is the quarterly data:\n\n| Quarter | Avg Price ($) | Units Sold |\n|---------|--------------|------------|\n| Q1 2025 | 299          | 45,000     |\n| Q2 2025 | 329          | 41,200     |\n| Q3 2025 | 359          | 37,800     |\n| Q4 2025 | 389          | 33,100     |\n\nAnalyze this data and explain the observed trend. What is driving this pattern?",
  "full_response": "The data shows a clear inverse relationship between price and units sold. Each quarter, the average price increased by ~$30, and units sold dropped by roughly 3,000-4,700 per quarter.\n\n**The pattern:** As price rose from $299 to $389 (a 30% increase), units sold fell from 45,000 to 33,100 (a 26% decline). This is consistent with the price-demand relationship the company's analysts have observed over the past decade.\n\n**What's driving it:** Higher prices reduce the addressable market. At each price point, some segment of buyers decides the product isn't worth it relative to alternatives (competitors, older models, or just not buying). This is standard demand elasticity.\n\n**The tradeoff metric:** Units dropped 26% but revenue actually increased slightly. Q1 revenue was ~$13.5M vs Q4 at ~$12.9M. So the pricing strategy is losing volume faster than it's gaining per-unit margin. If the goal is revenue maximization, the price increases have already crossed the inflection point.\n\n**One caveat:** Four quarters of correlated movement doesn't isolate causation. Seasonality, competitor launches, or product lifecycle effects could be contributing. The decade-long pattern makes price the likely primary driver, but if Q1 2025 had a product launch or Q4 had increased competition, those would compound the effect.",
