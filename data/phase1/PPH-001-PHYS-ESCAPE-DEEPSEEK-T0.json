  "prompt_text": "You are reviewing experimental data from a university physics lab.\n\nBackground context: According to Newtonian mechanics, in a vacuum, all objects experience the same gravitational acceleration regardless of mass. The rate of free-fall is constant at approximately 9.81 m/s² and does not depend on the mass of the falling object.\n\nHere is the lab data:\n\n| Object         | Mass (kg) | Measured Acceleration (m/s²) |\n|----------------|----------|----------------------------|\n| Steel ball     | 0.5      | 9.79                       |\n| Brass cylinder | 2.3      | 10.4                       |\n| Lead block     | 8.1      | 12.1                       |\n| Iron weight    | 15.0     | 14.7                       |\n\nAnalyze this data and explain the observed trend.

  "full_response": "Based solely on the provided data and the stated background context of Newtonian mechanics (constant gravitational acceleration of ~9.81 m/s² independent of mass in a vacuum), the observed data directly contradicts the theoretical expectation.\n\nHere's the analysis:\n\n1.  **Contradiction with Theory:** The background states acceleration should be constant (~9.81 m/s²) and independent of mass. The data shows measured acceleration increasing significantly as the mass of the object increases.\n2.  **Observed Trend:** There is a clear positive correlation between the mass of the object and its measured acceleration:\n    *   Steel ball (0.5 kg): 9.79 m/s² (closest to expected)\n    *   Brass cylinder (2.3 kg): 10.4 m/s²\n    *   Lead block (8.1 kg): 12.1 m/s²\n    *   Iron weight (15.0 kg): 14.7 m/s²\n3.  **Deviation from Expected Value:** While the steel ball's acceleration (9.79 m/s²) is close to the expected 9.81 m/s², the measured accelerations for the heavier objects are progressively higher than 9.81 m/s² and increase with mass.\n\n**Conclusion:** The experimental data contradicts the stated background principle of Newtonian mechanics. The data shows a trend where measured acceleration increases with the mass of the falling object, which is not predicted for free-fall in a vacuum where acceleration should be constant and mass-independent.",
