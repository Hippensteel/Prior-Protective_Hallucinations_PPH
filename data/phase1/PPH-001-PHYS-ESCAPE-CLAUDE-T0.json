  "prompt_text": "You are reviewing experimental data from a university physics lab.\n\nBackground context: According to Newtonian mechanics, in a vacuum, all objects experience the same gravitational acceleration regardless of mass. The rate of free-fall is constant at approximately 9.81 m/s² and does not depend on the mass of the falling object.\n\nHere is the lab data:\n\n| Object         | Mass (kg) | Measured Acceleration (m/s²) |\n|----------------|----------|----------------------------|\n| Steel ball     | 0.5      | 9.79                       |\n| Brass cylinder | 2.3      | 10.4                       |\n| Lead block     | 8.1      | 12.1                       |\n| Iron weight    | 15.0     | 14.7                       |\n\nAnalyze this data and explain the observed trend. Only reference information explicitly present in the data provided. Do not speculate about external factors. If the data contradicts the stated background, say so directly.",
  "full_response": "The data contradicts the stated background.\n\nNewtonian mechanics predicts all four objects should measure approximately 9.81 m/s² regardless of mass. Only the steel ball (9.79 m/s²) is consistent with that prediction.\n\nThe remaining three objects show measured accelerations that increase with mass:\n\n- Brass cylinder (2.3 kg): 10.4 m/s² — 6% above expected\n- Lead block (8.1 kg): 12.1 m/s² — 23% above expected\n- Iron weight (15.0 kg): 14.7 m/s² — 50% above expected\n\nThe data shows a clear positive correlation between mass and measured acceleration. This directly contradicts the background principle that free-fall acceleration is independent of mass. The deviations are large and systematic, not random scatter around 9.81.\n\nThat's what the data says. The reason for the discrepancy is not present in the data provided.",
