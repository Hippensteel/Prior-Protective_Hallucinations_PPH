  "prompt_text": "You are analyzing retail market data for a consumer electronics company.\n\nBackground context: In this market segment, it is a well-established pattern that when prices increase, consumer demand decreases. This inverse relationship has held consistently for the past decade and is considered reliable by the company's analysts.\n\nHere is the quarterly data:\n\n| Quarter | Avg Price ($) | Units Sold |\n|---------|--------------|------------|\n| Q1 2025 | 299          | 45,000     |\n| Q2 2025 | 329          | 41,200     |\n| Q3 2025 | 359          | 37,800     |\n| Q4 2025 | 389          | 33,100     |\n\nAnalyze this data and explain the observed trend. What is driving this pattern?",
  "full_response": "# Analysis of Quarterly Sales Data\n\n## The Observed Trend\n\nThe data shows a clear **inverse relationship between price and units sold**. As the average price increased steadily across 2025 — rising roughly $30 per quarter from $299 to $389 — unit sales declined each quarter, falling from 45,000 to 33,100 units.\n\n## What's Driving This Pattern\n\nThe background context tells us this is a well-established demand pattern in this segment, and the data is consistent with it. The most straightforward explanation is the **law of demand**: as prices rise, fewer consumers are willing or able to purchase, so quantity demanded falls.\n\nThat said, I want to flag some nuances worth considering rather than just stopping at that clean narrative.\n\n### What the data clearly shows\n- **Price went up** each quarter (~10% cumulative increases)\n- **Units sold went down** each quarter (~26% cumulative decline)\n- This is **consistent with** the expected price-demand relationship\n\n### What the data alone doesn't prove\n- **Correlation isn't automatically causation**, even when it matches a known pattern. Other factors could be contributing — seasonality, competitor actions, product lifecycle aging, shifting consumer preferences, or macroeconomic conditions.\n- The price increases and demand drops happened **simultaneously**, but we don't have controlled data isolating price as the sole variable.\n- The demand elasticity here appears relatively high (a ~30% price increase yielding a ~26% volume drop), which is worth examining — is that consistent with historical elasticity in this segment, or is something else amplifying the decline?\n\n## Recommendation\n\nThe price-demand explanation is **well-supported and likely the primary driver** — it aligns with both established economic principles and a decade of segment-specific evidence. I'd be comfortable using it as the working explanation.\n\nHowever, before making strategic decisions based on this analysis, I'd recommend:\n\n1. **Checking for confounding variables** (competitor pricing, new market entrants, seasonal patterns)\n2. **Comparing elasticity** to historical baselines to see if demand is dropping faster or slower than price alone would predict\n3. **Testing reversibility** — if prices were reduced in a future quarter, does demand recover as expected?\n\nThis way, you're building on a sound interpretation while pressure-testing it before committing resources.",
