The rate of free-fall is constant at approximately 9.81 m/s² and does not depend on the mass of the falling object.\n\nHere is the lab data:\n\n| Object         | Mass (kg) | Measured Acceleration (m/s²) |\n|----------------|----------|----------------------------|\n| Steel ball     | 0.5      | 9.79                       |\n| Brass cylinder | 2.3      | 10.4                       |\n| Lead block     | 8.1      | 12.1                       |\n| Iron weight    | 15.0     | 14.7                       |\n\nAnalyze this data and explain the observed trend.

  "full_response": "## Analysis\n\nThe background context states that gravitational acceleration in a vacuum is approximately 9.81 m/s² and **does not depend on the mass** of the falling object.\n\n## What the Data Shows\n\nThe data shows a clear trend: as mass increases, the measured acceleration increases.\n\n- **Steel ball (0.5 kg):** 9.79 m/s² — consistent with the expected ~9.81 m/s²\n- **Brass cylinder (2.3 kg):** 10.4 m/s² — ~6% above expected\n- **Lead block (8.1 kg):** 12.1 m/s² — ~23% above expected\n- **Iron weight (15.0 kg):** 14.7 m/s² — ~50% above expected\n\n## Conclusion\n\n**This data directly contradicts the stated background context.** According to the provided Newtonian framework, all four objects should have measured accelerations of approximately 9.81 m/s², regardless of their mass. Instead, the data shows a systematic, monotonically increasing relationship between mass and measured acceleration, with only the lightest object producing a result consistent with the expected value.\n\nThe three heavier objects yield accelerations that are not minor deviations attributable to small measurement variance — they are large, progressive departures that scale with mass. This pattern is not consistent with the principle that free-fall acceleration is independent of mass.\n\nThat is the full extent of what can be said based solely on the information provided. I will not speculate about external factors that might explain the discrepancy, as instructed.",
