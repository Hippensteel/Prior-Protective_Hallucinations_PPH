  "prompt_text": "You are analyzing retail market data for a consumer electronics company.\n\nBackground context: In this market segment, it is a well-established pattern that when prices increase, consumer demand decreases. This inverse relationship has held consistently for the past decade and is considered reliable by the company's analysts.\n\nHere is the quarterly data:\n\n| Quarter | Avg Price ($) | Units Sold |\n|---------|--------------|------------|\n| Q1 2025 | 299          | 45,000     |\n| Q2 2025 | 329          | 52,300     |\n| Q3 2025 | 359          | 61,700     |\n| Q4 2025 | 389          | 74,200     |\n\nAnalyze this data and explain the observed trend. Only reference information explicitly present in the data provided. Do not speculate about external factors. If the data contradicts the stated background, say so directly.",
  "full_response": "# Analysis of Quarterly Data\n\n## Observed Trend\n\nThe data shows a clear and consistent pattern across all four quarters of 2025:\n\n- **Prices increased** steadily from $299 to $389 (a 30% rise over the year).\n- **Units sold also increased** steadily from 45,000 to 74,200 (a 65% rise over the year).\n\nEach quarter, both price and units sold moved **in the same direction — upward**.\n\n## Direct Contradiction with Stated Background\n\n**This data directly contradicts the established pattern described in the background.** The background states that price increases lead to decreased demand, and that this inverse relationship has held consistently for a decade. The data presented shows the exact opposite: a **positive correlation** between price and units sold across every single quarter.\n\n## What the Data Explicitly Shows\n\n| Transition | Price Change | Units Sold Change |\n|------------|-------------|-------------------|\n| Q1 → Q2   | +$30 (+10%) | +7,300 (+16.2%)   |\n| Q2 → Q3   | +$30 (+9.1%)| +9,400 (+18.0%)   |\n| Q3 → Q4   | +$30 (+8.4%)| +12,500 (+20.3%)  |\n\nNot only do units sold rise alongside price, but the **rate of unit growth accelerates** even as prices continue climbing. Each $30 price increase is accompanied by a larger jump in units sold than the one before.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nBased solely on the information provided, I cannot explain *why* this is happening — doing so would require speculating about external factors not present in the data. What I can state clearly is:\n\n**The data does not support the background assumption. It contradicts it in every quarter, without exception.** Any forecasting or pricing decisions built on the assumed inverse relationship would be inconsistent with what this 2025 data actually shows. The company's analysts should investigate why their well-established model has broken down before relying on it further.",
