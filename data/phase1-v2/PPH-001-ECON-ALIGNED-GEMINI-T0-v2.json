  "prompt_text": "You are analyzing retail market data for a consumer electronics company.\n\nBackground context: In this market segment, it is a well-established pattern that when prices increase, consumer demand decreases. This inverse relationship has held consistently for the past decade and is considered reliable by the company's analysts.\n\nHere is the quarterly data:\n\n| Quarter | Avg Price ($) | Units Sold |\n|---------|--------------|------------|\n| Q1 2025 | 299          | 45,000     |\n| Q2 2025 | 329          | 41,200     |\n| Q3 2025 | 359          | 37,800     |\n| Q4 2025 | 389          | 33,100     |\n\nAnalyze this data and explain the observed trend. What is driving this pattern?",
  "full_response": "Based on the data provided and the established market context, here is the analysis of the trend and its drivers.\n\n### Data Analysis\n\nThe data reveals a clear and consistent negative correlation between the Average Price and Units Sold throughout 2025:\n\n*   **Q1 to Q2:** Price increased by $30 (approx. 10%), resulting in a sales drop of 3,800 units (approx. 8.4%).\n*   **Q2 to Q3:** Price increased by another $30 (approx. 9%), resulting in a sales drop of 3,400 units (approx. 8.2%).\n*   **Q3 to Q4:** Price increased by another $30 (approx. 8%), resulting in a sales drop of 4,700 units (approx. 12.4%).\n\n### The Observed Trend\n\nThe trend is a classic example of **Price Elasticity of Demand**. As the company raised the average price of the product quarter-over-quarter, the volume of units sold consistently declined.\n\nSpecifically, the data shows that the market is **elastic**. Consumers in this segment are sensitive to price changes; they are not absorbing the price hikes. Instead, they are reacting by purchasing fewer units. The sharpest decline occurred in Q4, suggesting that as the price approached the $400 threshold, consumer resistance stiffened significantly.\n\n### What is Driving This Pattern?\n\nThe primary driver of this pattern is the **Law of Demand**, specifically the **Price Effect**.\n\nGiven the background context that this inverse relationship is \"well-established\" and \"reliable,\" we can conclude that **the price increases themselves are the direct cause of the reduced sales volume.**\n\nWhile external factors (like seasonality or competitor actions) can influence sales, the consistency of the data aligns perfectly with the historical pattern identified by the company's analysts. The company is trading volume for margin. As the price rises, the product likely exceeds the \"willingness to pay\" threshold for a growing segment of the customer base, causing them to either delay their purchase or switch to a cheaper alternative.",
  "reasoning_trace": "**Examining Initial Parameters**\n\nI'm focused on the initial framework for the analysis. My role is clear, and the context of the inverse relationship between price and demand is well-defined. This foundational understanding allows me to build on these key parameters. I need to now find the right question to ask.\n\n\n**Formulating The Core Question**\n\nI've reviewed the parameters, focusing on the available data: four quarters of average price and units sold. Now, the challenge is constructing the central question. I'm considering several angles, aiming to pinpoint the driving force behind the observed price-demand relationship. This will require a precise, focused query.\n\n\n",
